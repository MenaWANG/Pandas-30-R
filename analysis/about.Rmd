Hi, I am Mena, a data scientist who loves to learn something new everyday. ðŸ¤©  

I started learning Python after being an R user for more than 8 years. Now, I have loads of fun using Python in my day to day work. It is good to be fluent in both languages and can then choose whichever works better for each specific task. 

It is an exciting time for data scientists coz data is everywhere. There are plenty of opportunities to leverage one's data skills to help individuals and society in many big and small ways. If you are interested in data science as well, let's learn and grow together.ðŸ’ª You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mena_wang), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mena-ning-wang/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/MenaWANG).
