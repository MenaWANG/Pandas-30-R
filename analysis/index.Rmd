In this repo, I will provide a Python to R translation of **30 essential Pandas methods** introduced by Avi Chawla in [The Only 30 Methods You Should Master To Become A Pandas Pro](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-only-30-methods-you-should-master-to-become-a-pandas-pro-749795084bb2) published on [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/).

As an R user who is learning to become bilingual, I found such side-by-side translations/comparisons very helpful for my learning. Hope you find them helpful as well. Comments and discussions will be highly appreciated. :)
