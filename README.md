# Pandas-30-R

In this repo, I provided a Python to R translation of 30 essential Pandas methods introduced by Avi Chawla in [The Only 30 Methods You Should Master To Become A Pandas Pro][] published on [TowardsDataScience][]. Please find [the project site here][]. The project is managed by {workflowr} to ensure reproducibility and version control/tracking (learn more about [the workflowr package][]).

The discussions of some of the methods went beyond the original, with more related methods illustrated/compared for more advanced or customized tasks. I will continue to add examples or relevant methods to enrich this site, as it now serves as a reference source for myself.  

Hope you find it helpful too. Comments and suggestions are always appreciated. :)
