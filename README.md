# Pandas-30-R

In this repo, I will provide a Python to R translation of 30 essential Pandas methods introduced by Avi Chawla in [The Only 30 Methods You Should Master To Become A Pandas Pro][] published on [TowardsDataScience][]. The project starts on 23 Oct, 2022 and I will add one method at least every 2-3 days.
 
The project is managed by {workflowr} to ensure reproducibility and version control/tracking. To learn more about [the workflowr package][].
