# Pandas-30-R

The repo started as an endeavour to translate 30 essential pandas methods to R when I started learning Python ([More on the 30 methods][]). Now it is almost like a personal reference or treasure collection üòù as I continue to add more Python tricks when they are discovered.

The project is [published here](https://menawang.github.io/Pandas-30-R/index.html).  

I hope you find it helpful too. Comments and suggestions are always appreciated. ü•∞

The project is managed by {workflowr} to ensure reproducibility and version control/tracking.([More on workflowr][]).
